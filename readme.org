#+title: xls-parser

A script which "transpiles" =xls= files into =python= files.

* Generating ~xls_parse.out.py~
  Run ~xls_parse.py /path/to/cpu_pa_report.xlsm~ which will generate
  the ~xls_parse.out.py~ file.

* Using ~xls_parse.out.py~
  The generated ~xls_parse.out.py~ can be used to print (in JSON
  format) all the derived counters calculated in the Excel file
  (without the need for the Excel).

  The ~xls_parse.out.py~ has a single input: the path to a directory
  with the ~paX.xml~ files (where ~X=1, ..., 17~) generated by created
  using the ~fapp~ utility.

  The python needs to be able to load the ~fapp_loader.py~ file.
